<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sprayed Cement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Spraying</li><li>Wet Spraying</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sprayed cement market is primarily divided into two types: dry spraying and wet spraying. Dry spraying involves the pneumatic application of dry cement mixed with additives, which is then moistened upon contact with the substrate, offering increased control and less waste. Wet spraying, on the other hand, uses a pre-mixed slurry of cement and water, allowing for smoother applications and reducing dust. Both methods are utilized in construction for applications like tunnel lining and slope stabilization, each catering to specific project needs.</p></p>
