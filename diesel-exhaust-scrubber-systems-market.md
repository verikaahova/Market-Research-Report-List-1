<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Exhaust Scrubber Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Closed Type</li><li>Hybrid Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Diesel exhaust scrubber systems help reduce emissions from marine vessels. The market can be categorized into three types: Open Type systems use seawater to neutralize exhaust gases, discharging treated water back into the ocean. Closed Type systems use a closed-loop system with fresh water, recycling it after treatment, minimizing environmental impact. Hybrid Type systems combine both approaches, allowing operators to switch between open and closed modes depending on regulations and conditions, providing flexibility for compliance and operational efficiency.</p></p>
