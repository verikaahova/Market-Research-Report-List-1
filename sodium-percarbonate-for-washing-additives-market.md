<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sodium Percarbonate for Washing Additives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>COP (Sodium Percarbonate, Coated)</li><li>WPC (Sodium Percarbonate, Uncoated)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sodium percarbonate, commonly used as a washing additive, is available in two main types: Coated (COP) and Uncoated (WPC). COP consists of sodium percarbonate that is coated with surfactants or other materials to enhance stability and reduce reactivity until use, making it suitable for long-term storage. In contrast, WPC is uncoated, offering immediate release of active oxygen upon contact with water. Both types provide effective stain removal and whitening properties, catering to varying consumer needs in laundry applications.</p></p>
